## What does jq.InfiniteSlide.js do?

> Out of a collection of images, create an infinite scrolling

  - Programatic sliding
  - Touch Friendly
  - 

## What needs to be added:
  - Remove the coupling to images, both within variable names and jquery selectors
  - Look at removing jquery dependency - pure js
  - Add config for wrapper container and the inner container
  - Create a less file for the css
  - Destroy method
  - Additional options based on responsive breakpoints
